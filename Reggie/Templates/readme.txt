These are csppg templates that generate into the Generators folder as a prebuild step.
Not all of the files in the Generators folder are generated by a tool.
RggTargetGenerator.cs is handwritten and does not use csppg.
However, for the most part these are ASP like templates where the "server side" code
is always C#. The templates are usually invoked via the Arguments Expando
if you call args.Foo() and your target is "cs" it will try to find and call "CSFoo.template"
and it will only call Foo.template if it is not found. See TableMatcher.template and CompiledMatcher.template
for two examples of templates that use the expando based Arguments generation dispatching system.
