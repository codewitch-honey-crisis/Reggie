Most of these files are generated from the Templates directory.
RggTargetGenerator is not, since it is a binary generator and does not render using the csppg template engine.
Be careful about deleting the files in this folder as a consequence
Also do not make a template called RggTargetGenerator.template or the hand written code will be overwritten
